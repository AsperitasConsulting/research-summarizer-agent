"""Data models for the Research Summarizer Agent.

The spec leaves the model library choice open; this build uses Pydantic v2 so
that ``model_json_schema()`` can produce the tool schema for Anthropic's
structured-output endpoint without manual JSON wrestling.

No field validators or constraints are declared here. All bounds (synopsis
sentence count, findings count, citation URL provenance) are enforced by the
prompt only, per the spec.
